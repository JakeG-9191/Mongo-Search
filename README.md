# Mongo-Search
An application that uses Mongo to provide the latest headlines to users from the Washington Post.

# Application Details
The Washington Post Mongo Scraper allows the user direct access to the most recent headlines from the Washington Post. Visit the deployed version of the application at 

Users will first visit the page, where they will be greeted with directions on how to initate the scraping. Once articles have been scraped, users have the ability to look at a variety of headlines from the Washington Post.

Clicking on one of the articles will bring up additional features on the right side of the page. These features allow the user to either visit the article in question on the Washington Post's Website or to "save" the article for thier future refernce.

If a user saves an article, the page will be refreshed and the article in question will no longer be displayed. Users can then visit thier "saved" articles, which will route them to a seperate page.

Within the Saved Articles page, users can click on an article, similar to the way they did on the Home page, which will bring up an array of new options. Users can delete an article from thier saved array, which removes that article, they can visit the article on the Post's website, they can add a comment on the article complete with a title, or they can see a previous comment if they have previously saved one, this will display in the box below where they can enter in a new article.

# Known Bugs / Future Updates
Currently, users can only save one comment per article, and in order to see a previous comment they must click on the article again, in the future this is planned to allow for additional comments.
